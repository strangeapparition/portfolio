            <p>Well, what do you expect, mother? I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it. I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense. Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough. There's only one man I've ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is a television actor. I'm afraid I just blue myself. Michael! Whoa, this guy's straight? Noâ€¦ but I'd like to be asked! That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.' Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right. I'm a monster. There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. Really? Did nothing cancel? What's Spanish for "I know you speak English?" Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn't like his trailer. That's why you always leave a note!</p>
